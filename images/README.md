# Sample Image Directory

This directory contains images that are managed by Obsidian and other content management tools.

Images placed here will be automatically copied to the public directory during build.

## Usage in Markdown

You can reference images in your markdown files like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/content/image-name.jpg)
```

Or for blog posts with relative paths:

```markdown
![Alt text](./images/image-name.jpg)
```
