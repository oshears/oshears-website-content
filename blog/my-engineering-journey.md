As I reflect on my journey through engineering and research, I'm struck by how passion for technology and learning has guided each step of my career. From my undergraduate days at George Mason University to my current role as a Senior Research Engineer at USC's Information Sciences Institute, each experience has built upon the last, creating a unique path in the world of engineering.

## Early Foundations at George Mason University

My journey began at George Mason University, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from 2014 to 2018. This period was transformative, not just academically but in terms of developing leadership skills and finding my passion for teaching.

### Academic Excellence and Recognition

During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to receive numerous awards that validated my academic efforts:

- **Summa Cum Laude** and **Dean's List** recognition throughout my studies
- **ECE Chairman's Award** and **ECE Outstanding Academic Achievement Award**
- **Honors College** membership, which provided additional research opportunities

### Leadership and Service

What truly shaped me during this time were the leadership roles I took on:

- **President of F1rst Gen Mason** (2016-2017), where I designed a new visual identity and developed a mobile GPA calculator app
- **Technology Coordinator & STEP Logistics Coordinator** for the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Multicultural Education
- **Learning Assistant** for digital systems design courses, helping nearly 150 students

### The Impact of Project LENS

My senior design project, **Project LENS** - A Robotic Eye System Using Artificial Muscles, was a pivotal moment. Winning both the ECE Senior Design Project Award and Dean's Advisory Board Award gave me confidence in my ability to innovate and solve complex engineering problems. This project demonstrated my passion for interdisciplinary work, combining robotics, bioengineering, and control systems.

## Discovering My Passion for Tutoring

In 2017, I began tutoring on Wyzant, specializing in computer science, computer engineering, and programming languages. What started as a way to help fellow students has become a nearly 5-year journey of helping students master subjects like Verilog, VHDL, Java, Python, C++, and Calculus.

The testimonials from students have been incredibly rewarding:

> "Osaze by far is probably one of the best tutors, hands down! He really takes the time to understand and improve my daughter's grades. My daughter really enjoys every lesson with Osaze as he is very patient."

This experience taught me the importance of patience, clear communication, and adapting my teaching style to each student's needs - skills that have proven invaluable in my research and professional work.

## Professional Growth at BAE Systems

My internship and subsequent full-time role at BAE Systems (2017-2020) provided crucial industry experience. As a **Virginia Microelectronics Consortium (VMEC) Intern** and later a **Digital Logic Design Engineer**, I worked on:

- UVM test sequences for ASIC verification (PCI, JTAG, I2C protocols)
- Memory built-in self-test (MBIST) automation and fuse repair scripts
- Design for test pattern generation for the RAD5545 single-board computer

This experience was invaluable in understanding how academic knowledge translates to real-world engineering challenges. Mentoring interns during this time also reinforced my passion for teaching and developing the next generation of engineers.

## Graduate Studies and Research Focus

In 2020, I transitioned to Virginia Tech for my Master's in Computer Engineering, working under the Multifunctional Integrated Circuits and Systems (MICS) Lab. This period marked my deep dive into neuromorphic computing and hardware acceleration.

### Research Interests Evolution

My research interests crystallized around:

- **Spiking Neural Networks** and their hardware implementations
- **Hardware Acceleration** for machine learning workloads
- **SoC Design** with ASICs and FPGAs
- **Edge Computing** and low-power solutions

### Publications and Recognition

The culmination of my graduate work was the publication of "A Hybrid FPGA-ASIC Delayed Feedback Reservoir System to Enable Spectrum Sensing/Sharing for Low Power IoT Devices" at ICCAD 2021, co-authored with Kangjun Bai, Lingjia Liu, and Yang Yi. This work represents the convergence of my interests in neuromorphic computing, hardware design, and practical applications.

## Current Role and Future Directions

As a **Senior Research Engineer** at USC Information Sciences Institute since 2020, I work under the Reconfigurable Computing Group on FPGA security research and development. This role allows me to:

- Test cutting-edge Xilinx FPGA devices (Versal, UltraScale+, Zynq)
- Contribute to FPGA security research
- Bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications

## Reflections on My Journey

Looking back, several themes emerge:

### The Power of Interdisciplinary Thinking

From Project LENS to neuromorphic computing research, my most successful work has been at the intersection of multiple disciplines. This approach has allowed me to bring fresh perspectives to traditional engineering problems.

### Teaching as Learning

My tutoring experience and various teaching assistant roles have reinforced that teaching is one of the best ways to deepen understanding. Every student I've helped has also taught me something new about communication, problem-solving, or the subject matter itself.

### The Importance of Mentorship

From being mentored as a VMEC intern to mentoring undergraduate students in graduate school, I've experienced both sides of the mentorship relationship. These experiences have shaped my leadership style and commitment to developing others.

### Balancing Theory and Practice

My career has successfully balanced theoretical research with practical applications. This balance has been crucial in ensuring that my research work has real-world relevance and impact.

## Looking Forward

As I continue in my career, I'm excited about the growing applications of neuromorphic computing and hardware acceleration. The convergence of AI, edge computing, and specialized hardware presents unprecedented opportunities to solve complex real-world problems.

My future goals include:

- Continuing to bridge academic research and industry applications
- Expanding my work in augmented and mixed reality applications
- Mentoring the next generation of engineers and researchers
- Pursuing opportunities where interdisciplinary collaboration can drive innovation

## Personal Philosophy

Throughout this journey, I've been guided by a simple philosophy: engineering should benefit society, and knowledge should be shared freely. Whether through tutoring students, mentoring interns, or conducting research that has practical applications, I believe engineers have a responsibility to use their skills for the greater good.

The path from undergraduate student to research engineer has been filled with challenges, learning opportunities, and incredible support from mentors, colleagues, and students. Each experience has contributed to my growth not just as an engineer, but as a person committed to making a positive impact through technology and education.
