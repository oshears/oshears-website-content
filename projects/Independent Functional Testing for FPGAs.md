<!--
This project focuses on developing independent functional testing methodologies for FPGA designs, addressing the critical need for comprehensive verification in reconfigurable computing applications. The work emphasizes creating robust testing frameworks that can validate FPGA functionality across different operating conditions and use cases.

## Project Overview

Independent functional testing for FPGAs involves developing testing methodologies that can verify the correctness of FPGA implementations without relying on the original design specifications. This approach is particularly important for:

- **Security Applications**: Verifying that FPGA designs haven't been compromised or contain unintended functionality
- **Third-Party Verification**: Validating FPGA implementations from external vendors
- **Design Validation**: Ensuring FPGA designs meet functional requirements across all operating conditions
- **Reliability Assessment**: Determining the robustness of FPGA implementations under various stress conditions

## Technical Approach

### Test Generation Strategies

The project employs multiple test generation approaches:

- **Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)**: Systematic generation of test vectors for comprehensive coverage
- **Random Testing**: Statistical approach to uncover corner cases and unexpected behaviors
- **Directed Testing**: Targeted tests for specific functionality and edge cases
- **Stress Testing**: Evaluation under extreme operating conditions

### Verification Methodologies

Key verification techniques include:

- **Functional Coverage Analysis**: Ensuring all functionality is properly tested
- **Code Coverage Metrics**: Measuring the completeness of test execution
- **Assertion-Based Verification**: Using formal properties to validate behavior
- **Cross-Reference Testing**: Comparing against reference implementations

## Applications
