My work on emulating and helping with verification efforts for this ASIC were a part of the [TRACER: Tasklet Reconfigurable Agile speCtrum procEssoR](https://www.isi.edu/projects-tracer/) at USC ISI. This effort was funded by DARPA's PROWESS program.

- Emulated ESP NoC on VCU128, VCU118
- integrated and verified custom spectrum sensing accelerator IP using waveforms in Cadence Xcelium/NCSim
