The comprehensive independent functional testing (CIFT) project for FPGAs has been my primary project while working at USC ISI. This project involves testing all of the configurable/programmable logic within FPGAs across different vendors. My focus was on Xilinx FPGAs from Versal, UltraScale+, Zynq, and Series 7 families.

In particular for this project, my major contributions included:
- developing path delay tests for all series 7 devices to test delays for all BELs within configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
- Developed slice, BRAM, interconnect and security tests (secure boot, AES decryption IP and RSA authentication) for Versal devices
- Developed security tests for Zynq (secure boot) and UltraScale+ decides (AES deception IP)

I have had several direct interactions with the customer for this project (JFAC, NSWC) and attended several GOMAC conferences to support in discussions and publications surrounding this work. 

This work allowed me to work with a variety of development boards and the latest versions of Vivado and Vitis tools. I have also worked with legacy tools (ISE) to debug and provide support for deprecated hardware that is still in use by certain mission critical systems.

This project greatly developed my Python scripting skills, in addition to experience using VHDL to configure various FPGA designs and instantiating different low level macros from the library. TCL was also used extensively to automate certain parts of the design tool flows.

Using Vitis for the parametric tests provided a uniquely different experience. For the Series 7 devices, we instantiated a small microblaze CPU and loaded a bare metal C application for driving the tests and collecting the path delay results to transmit via UART and JTAG.

As a large software based project, this included extensive documentation via wikis, issue tracking in GitLab, and continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) flows. We also maintained several pieces of documentation in LaTeX (User Guide, Technical Data Package).

This project focuses on developing independent functional testing methodologies for FPGA designs, addressing the critical need for comprehensive verification in reconfigurable computing applications. The work emphasizes creating robust testing frameworks that can validate FPGA functionality across different operating conditions and use cases.

## Project Overview

Independent functional testing for FPGAs involves developing testing methodologies that can verify the correctness of FPGA implementations without relying on the original design specifications. This approach is particularly important for:

- **Security Applications**: Verifying that FPGA designs haven't been compromised or contain unintended functionality
- **Third-Party Verification**: Validating FPGA implementations from external vendors
- **Design Validation**: Ensuring FPGA designs meet functional requirements across all operating conditions
- **Reliability Assessment**: Determining the robustness of FPGA implementations under various stress conditions

## Technical Approach

### Test Generation Strategies

The project employs multiple test generation approaches:

- **Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)**: Systematic generation of test vectors for comprehensive coverage
- **Random Testing**: Statistical approach to uncover corner cases and unexpected behaviors
- **Directed Testing**: Targeted tests for specific functionality and edge cases
- **Stress Testing**: Evaluation under extreme operating conditions

### Verification Methodologies

Key verification techniques include:

- **Functional Coverage Analysis**: Ensuring all functionality is properly tested
- **Code Coverage Metrics**: Measuring the completeness of test execution
- **Assertion-Based Verification**: Using formal properties to validate behavior
- **Cross-Reference Testing**: Comparing against reference implementations

## Applications

This testing methodology is applicable to:

### Security-Critical Systems
- Verification of cryptographic implementations
- Detection of hardware trojans and malicious modifications
- Validation of secure communication protocols

### High-Reliability Applications
- Aerospace and defense systems
- Medical device implementations
- Industrial control systems
- Automotive safety systems

### Commercial FPGA Validation
- Third-party IP core verification
- Supply chain security validation
- Quality assurance for FPGA products

## Key Contributions

- **Custom Testing Framework**: Specialized tools developed for independent testing

## Results and Impact

The testing methodology has demonstrated:

- **Improved Detection Rates**: Higher success in identifying functional errors and security vulnerabilities
- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: Faster validation cycles through automated testing
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Better confidence in FPGA implementation correctness
- **Security Assurance**: Improved ability to detect malicious modifications

## Future Directions

Ongoing development includes:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Using AI techniques to improve test generation and analysis
