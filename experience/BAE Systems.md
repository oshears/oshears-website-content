### Overview
- \item {Developed and maintained SystemVerilog/UVM testbenches for functional verification of 10+ critical IP cores including PCI, I2C, UART, and SPI interfaces on production SoCs.}
- \item {Created a Perl framework for generating wafer-level and package-level test patterns for SerDes and MBIST IP validation on RAD5545 SoCs, ensuring production-quality hardware functionality.}
- \item {Mentored interns in the development of memory test and repair for SoCs using C++ and JTAG Corelis boundary-scan hardware.}
- \item{Presented automated MBIST test insertion methodology research to Virginia Microelectronics Consortium (VMEC), demonstrating innovation in test automation.}

### Summary

As a Digital Logic Design Engineer at BAE Systems Inc., I worked on critical defense technology projects involving ASIC verification and testing. My role encompassed both technical development and leadership responsibilities.

### Key Responsibilities

**ASIC Verification & Testing:**

- Created various UVM test sequences for verifying several protocols on ASICs including PCI, JTAG, and I2C
- Constructed several scripts to automate memory built-in self-test (MBIST) operations and fuse repairs
- Performed design for test pattern generation and bring-up tasks on the RAD5545 single-board computer
- Led VMEC interns in their projects (2018, 2019)
- Conducted MBIST Wafer and Module Testing for RAD5545
- Worked with JTAG Corelis systems
- Performed UVM Verification for UART on RAD510

**Leadership & Community:**

- Mentored a team of interns in programming software to perform memory test and repair tasks
- Served in the onsite Young Professionals and Health & Wellness committees

### VMEC Internship Experience

Prior to my full-time role, I was a **Virginia Microelectronics Consortium (VMEC) Intern** from May 2017 to December 2017, where I gained:

- Experience documenting and integrating memory built-in self-test (MBIST) systems written in Verilog and VHDL
- Experience modifying and simulating Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) Test Benches

This internship provided me with foundational knowledge that directly contributed to my success as a full-time engineer and prepared me for the advanced verification work I would later perform on critical defense systems.
