### Overview

- \item {Implemented Zynq-7000 FPGA interface for analog neuromorphic image classifier ASIC using embedded processor, DAC, ADC, and custom AXI IP, enabling mixed-signal functionality.}
- \item {Developed bare-metal applications to run on Zynq-7000 ARM processor to read and write data to analog ASIC bridge.}
- \item {Configured PetaLinux image and device tree for AXI memory-mapped IP addressing from Linux userspace. Created Python scripts to further streamline IP configuration and evaluation.}
- \item {Used TCL to automate Vivado's FPGA block design and bitstream generation for reproducibility and continuous integration.}
- \item {Designed recurrent neural network IP using C++ and Intel HLS Compiler for BladeRF software defined radio. Performed verification using ModelSim co-simulation, and implemented bitstream generated for the on-board Cyclone V FPGA.}
- \item {Led and instructed a team of 4 undergraduate students in FPGA machine learning accelerator design, providing technical guidance and project oversight.}

### Summary

As a Graduate Research Assistant at Virginia Tech's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, I conducted research under the Multifunctional Integrated Circuits and Systems (MICS) Lab led by Dr. Yang Cindy Yi. My work focused on studying neuromorphic computing implementations on digital integrated circuits and collaborating with fellow graduate students to develop next-generation machine learning hardware leveraging neuromorphic computing.
