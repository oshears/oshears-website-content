- Architected and **integrated a top-level SoC design** using **SystemVerilog** with **JTAG, PLL, SerDes**, and custom IP for a homomorphic encryption ASIC. Interfaced memory-mapped control-status registers with **AXI4Lite** interconnect for external FPGA access.
- Developed **comprehensive FPGA test platforms** using Vivado and Vitis across Xilinx Versal, UltraScale+, and Series 7 devices to validate functionality of slices, interconnect, and hard IP blocks. **C** code developed for MicroBlaze to enable run-time testing.
- Developed **codebase for automating EDA tool build processes and FPGA debugging** using **Python** and **TCL**. Maintained codebase using GitLab CI/CD flows, merge requests, and issue tracking.
- Implemented and **optimized MobileNet accelerator on Zynq ZCU104** using Xilinx FINN framework, **Python**, **Xilinx HLS**, and **C**. Worked towards energy efficiency and latency improvements for object detection and tracking with the BDD100K dataset.
- Performed **functional verification and debugging of NoC-based ASIC** architectures using **Xcelium** and emulations on VCU128.
- Collaborated with interns to bring-up a **Synopsys HAPS-100 prototyping** platform for emulation of ASIC designs.
- Maintained **GitLab** Wiki repositories to document workflows, facilitate knowledge sharing, and host project documentation.
- Performed formal equivalence checking using **Synopsys Formality** on FPGA netlists generated by Synopsys **Synplify** and Xilinx **Vivado**.
