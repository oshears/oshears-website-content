### Teaching Philosophy

I believe in taking the time to understand each student's unique learning style and challenges. My approach emphasizes:

- Patient, step-by-step explanations
- Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts
- Ensuring students understand the underlying concepts, not just the solution
- Building confidence through guided practice
